The data generated by the functions in app.py is returned as a JSON document.

The page title is the 'title' component, the main HTML body is 'body.

The render this as HTML the following needs to be set as the response integration 
body template. 

    #set($inputRoot = $input.path('$')) 
    <html><head><title>$inputRoot.title</title></head>
    <body>$inputRoot.body</body></html>


To avoid any browser issues the response content-type should also be changed to:

    text/html

For these changes to take effect, the API must be redeployed. And the changes
will need to be made after every chalice deploy until I get around to automating it.
